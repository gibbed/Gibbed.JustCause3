 - Extract to your game directory. You can find your
   game directory in Steam by:

     - Right-click Just Cause 3.
     - Choose "Properties".
     - Change to the "Local Files" tab.
     - Click "Browse Local Files...".

   Make sure you extract using directories! the files need to end up under
   the dropzone directory in the game directory!

 - You will need to add a few command-line arguments to enable the dropzone
   directory:
   
   --vfs-fs dropzone --vfs-archive patch_win64 --vfs-archive archives_win64 --vfs-fs .
   
   You can easily set this through Steam by:
     - Right-click Just Cause 3.
     - Choose "Properties".
     - Click "Set Launch Options...".
     - Paste the arguments line into the text box, and click "OK".
